# meme-generator

This project involves developing an interactive web application using React and functional programming techniques. 

Upon initial loading, the application seamlessly retrieves a collection of the top 100 memes from an external API. It then presents a randomly selected image to the user, and offers them an opportunity to personalise the meme by adding customized text to the image via two input fields.
